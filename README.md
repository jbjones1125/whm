The idea is you **always** want the global cooldown running, you accomplish this by pressing a [spell](#Spells) every time you can. [Abilities](#Abilities) are used inbetween spells, at most you can weave two abilities for every one spell.

When fighting one enemy you spam Glare, keep the Dia DoT ticking, and press Assize off cooldown.


### 3+ Enemies:
![aoe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077344306219733142/aoe.png)

When fighting 3 or more enemies, you spam Holy and press Assize off cooldown.

#### IMPORTANT: Both Holy and Assize form a circle of damage with you at the center, so you have to be close to the enemies or allies for it to hit them.

## Presence of Mind:

- **Dungeons** - Use when your tank gets a big group of monsters so you can spam Holy faster (or you can save it for the boss, who cares).

- **Boss** - Press off cooldown (to spam Glare faster).

## The Lily Gauge (Job Gauge)
![Default Job Gauge](https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/promo/h/Q/XGVUBM4Mjd3eJ5fNjiPfrBw60g.png)

This is the default White Mage job gauge. I think it looks like shit and it has awful clarity. So to make things easier, switch it to the much better ***Simple*** job gauge. You can switch between the job gauges by typing the `/jobhudmode` command in chat.

![Simple Job Gauge](https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/promo/h/K/k2Ag8uoD-I5rtzbhx3YVpWcv_A.png)

This is the simple job gauge. At the top you have three spots for lilies and at the bottom you have 3 spots for blood lilies.
The bar charges up while you're in combat and once it fills it gives you 1 Lily. This lily is what you need to be able to use Afflatus Solace and Afflatus Rapture, the instant cast GCD single target heal and aoe heal.
Once you use 3 lilies and fully fill the blood lily gauge (fill the 3 spots with red), you can cast Afflatus Misery, which is a big aoe nuke on a target (it's satisfying).
