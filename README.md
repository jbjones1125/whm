![Abilities](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077325712454848574/Abilities.png)


The idea is you **always** want the global cooldown running, you accomplish this by pressing a [spell](#Spells) every time you can. [Abilities](#Abilities) are used inbetween spells, at most you can weave two abilities for every one spell.

## Damage

### Single Target:
![Single Target](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077343091796742174/SingleTarget.png)

When fighting one enemy you spam Glare, keep the Dia DoT ticking, and press Assize off cooldown.


### 3+ Enemies:
![aoe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077344306219733142/aoe.png)

When fighting 3 or more enemies, you spam Holy and press Assize off cooldown.

#### IMPORTANT: Both Holy and Assize form a circle of damage with you at the center, so you have to be close to the enemies or allies for it to hit them.

## Presence of Mind:

- **Dungeons** - Use when your tank gets a big group of monsters so you can spam Holy faster (or you can save it for the boss, who cares).

- **Boss** - Press off cooldown (to spam Glare faster).

## The Lily Gauge (Job Gauge)
![Default Job Gauge](https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/promo/h/Q/XGVUBM4Mjd3eJ5fNjiPfrBw60g.png)

This is the default White Mage job gauge. I think it looks like shit and it has awful clarity. So to make things easier, switch it to the much better ***Simple*** job gauge. You can switch between the job gauges by typing the `/jobhudmode` command in chat.

![Simple Job Gauge](https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/promo/h/K/k2Ag8uoD-I5rtzbhx3YVpWcv_A.png)

This is the simple job gauge. At the top you have three spots for lilies and at the bottom you have 3 spots for blood lilies.
The bar charges up while you're in combat and once it fills it gives you 1 Lily. This lily is what you need to be able to use Afflatus Solace and Afflatus Rapture, the instant cast GCD single target heal and aoe heal.
Once you use 3 lilies and fully fill the blood lily gauge (fill the 3 spots with red), you can cast Afflatus Misery, which is a big aoe nuke on a target (it's satisfying).

>Advanced: Using three lily heals and then the Afflatus Misery to do big damage does the same amount of damage as if you had just cast Glare the entire time without healing at all, so if you used 2-3 lilies in a boss fight already, you should try to finish filling the blood lily gauge and cast Afflatus Misery before the boss dies.
This doesn't mean to spam your heals to get it out as fast as possible, but if the boss dies without you using your nuke you've "wasted" damage.

## General Gameplay

In FFXIV, EVERYONE does damage, EVERYONE is a DPS.
The majority of your button presses as a white mage are going to be Glare. Your goal is to get off as much damage as possible without anyone dying.

## Reminders:

### READ YOUR ROLE ACTIONS!
- **Repose**: It puts enemies to sleep no one ever uses this
- **Surecast**: Stops most knockbacks from knocking you back and most pulls from pulling you
- **Rescue**: Brings a target ally to your side, good for trolling
- **Swiftcast**: Pretty much just save it for use in conjunction with Raise
- **Lucid Dreaming**: When you're at about ~80% mana during a boss fight, use this, pretty much use it off CD
- **Esuna**: Removes a debuff from an ally (Not all debuffs)

### What the ***fuck*** is Esuna?
![Esuna](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/mediawiki/images/thumb/2/26/ThingsThatCanBeEsuna.png/500px-ThingsThatCanBeEsuna.png)

I didn't make that pic but it's pretty good, just make sure to look at your party's debuffs to see if you can remove any. You can only remove debuffs with the white bar at the top, absolutely be on top of this. (Unless you deem the debuff isn't worth your time)

IF YOU CAN ESUNA `DOOM`, YOU GOTTA.
