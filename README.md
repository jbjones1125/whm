The idea is you **always** want the global cooldown running, you accomplish this by pressing a [spell](#Spells) every time you can. [Abilities](#Abilities) are used inbetween spells, at most you can weave two abilities for every one spell.

## Damage
### Single Target:
![Glare](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077336614600183808/Glare.png) Default damaging spell, spam it if you have nothing better to do
![Dia](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077336626436509707/Dia.png) Damage over time, have it ticking on an enemy all the time, try to refresh the DoT when it has ~2 seconds left
![Assize](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/494294585741410305/1077336642429386844/Assize.png) Instant cast AoE damage and heal, this is typically used more for the damage than the heal so don't be afraid to use this everytime its off cooldown
